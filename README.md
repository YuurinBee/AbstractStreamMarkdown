## About
GM. I'm **YuurinBee**, but most people just call me "**Bee**". I've been in crypto since 2017 and have been mainly working and contributing in the realms of gaming, privacy, art, and finance. Love to contribute to open-source projects that have grand visions to reshape the way we look and experience life, primarily through technology and applications. On Abstract, I will be doing a lot of Web3 Gaming, as well as a 2D Design and some Pixel Art. *If any of these subjects interest you, feel to follow and hop in to introduce yourself*. One of the best places to get in touch with me is via [**Twitter(X)**](https://x.com/YuurinB)🐦

### Add Line Breaks 
> Add line breaks to add spacing and padding to your text, making it easier to read.

**To create a line break, hit `Shift + Enter` after your last bit of text or emoji**.

Note: Currently, Abstract Stream Portal doesn't allow you to just add consecutive spaces, so you will have to add some type of text then follow the command above to create a line break or additional spacing. If you want to make it look simple and clean, you can use the em dash `—` and then hit `Shift + Enter` afterwards.
